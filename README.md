# React Flow Relay Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  

More about [React](https://reactjs.org).

More about [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay).  

Install: `yarn install && yarn run setup`  
Relay: `yarn run relay`  
Run: `yarn start`  
Build: `yarn run build`  
Test: `yarn run test` (No tests present at this moment)  
Eject: `yarn run eject`  
Flow: `yarn run flow`  

The `yarn` command can be replaced with `npm`.  

This example can be used in combination with `node-express-sequelize-graphql-example`.  

Caution: This repo contains a fragile hack in `./setup.js` to make `create-react-app` compatible with `relay`. Execute `yarn run eject` to configure your own dependencies, or wait until `create-react-app 2.0` is released for native `relay` support.
